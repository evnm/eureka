# Eureka Invention Generator

Eureka generates random inventions by analyzing the word frequencies of US patent application abstracts. By implementing a [Markov processor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_process), it produces pseudo-readable text based on US patent abstract source material. In effect, Eureka is able to babble in the language used in patent writeups.

All patent information was taken from [Data.gov](http://www.data.gov/details/2). Eureka was designed and built as an entry to Sunlight Labs' [Apps for America 2](http://sunlightlabs.com/contests/appsforamerica2/) challenge.

This repo mainly served as a code dump to satisfy the open source requirement of the Apps for America 2 challenge. In the wake of the contest, it is left for posterity.
