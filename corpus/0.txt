The association is recorded in a user profile set up by the user and stored in the collaboration messaging system. If a wireless communications device is detected proximate to a messaging client computer, a search is made of stored user profiles, each of which associates a particular wireless communication with a particular user. If a profile exists for the detected wireless communication device, it is retrieved and a set of actions defined in the user profile is implemented. The defined actions include sending messages addressed to the users own messaging client computer to the proximate messaging client computer, sending notices of the messages to the proximate client computer and sending a notice to the sender of the message that the user is near a particular client messaging computer.

The invention provides a support system for searching for a function, including: a first storage for storing a history of at least one output parameter of each of a plurality of functions; an input section for receiving an input of an output parameter expected as an output of a function for a search; a calculating section for calculating first indexes respectively indicating proximity of the output parameter as inputted to each of those stored in the first storage, and summing the calculated first indexes for each function; and an output section for selecting, from among the plurality of functions, a function having a sum of the first indexes larger than a predetermined value, and outputting the selected function.
A system and method is provided of creating meta tags for a multi-media object. The method can include the operation of choosing a template model that includes meta tags. The user can also select the multi-media object from an electronic storage device. Another operation is associating the multi-media object with the template model in response to a user's request. The meta tags from the template model can be assigned to the multi-media object stored on the electronic storage device.
A search service providing system provides, on an overlay network configured such that at least one node is assigned on a hash space by a distributed hash table technique, a search service for searching at least one resource shared on the overlay network. The node includes: an information collecting unit that collects the resource; a resource database in which the resource collected by the information collecting unit is stored; and a search service providing unit that when a search request for the resource shared on the overlay network is received from a node other than an own node, searches the content of the resource stored in the resource database and outputs a result of the search to the node which has requested the search.
A method, article of manufacture and apparatus for performing private retrieval of information from a database is disclosed. In one embodiment, the method comprising obtaining an index corresponding to information to be retrieved from the database and generating a query that does not reveal the index to the database. The query is an arithmetic function of the index and a secret value, wherein the arithmetic function includes a multiplication group specified by a modulus of a random value whose order is divisible by a prime power, such that the prime power is an order of the random value. The secret value is an arithmetic function of the index that comprises a factorization into prime numbers of the modulus. The method further comprises communicating the query to the database for execution of the arithmetic function against the entirety of the database.
A computer-implemented method is disclosed for visualizing data relationships between components of a project for identifying potential duplication of selected components. One of the components is data collection assignments.
Articles of manufacture and methods are described. Specifically, the methods include constructing category structures within a database, classifying a data item within a database, and facilitating location of a data item within a database are described. A first method includes defining, in a database, a first structure of categories and an alternative second structure of categories to provide an alternative classification of a data item. A second method includes classifying a data item in a first hierarchy of categories and a second alternative hierarchy of categories. A third method includes locating a data item responsive to identifying of a link between a first hierarchy of categories and a second alternative hierarchy of categories.
Methods, systems, and apparatus, including computer program products, in which a cross-language search can be performed. A search query is received in a first language. A translated search query of the search query is obtained and evaluated to determine whether it is a candidate for cross-language searching. Upon identifying a candidate, a search can be performed using the translated search query to generate search results relevant to the translated search query.
A computer readable storage medium includes executable instructions to capture data access commands from a query module utilizing a semantic layer. The data access commands are processed to produce table specification instructions and data access instructions to facilitate the construction and population of a table.
Words having selected characteristics in a corpus of documents are found using a data processor arranged to execute queries. Memory stores an index structure in which entries in the index structure map words and marks for words having the selected characteristics to locations within documents in the corpus. Entries in the index structure represent words and other entries represent marks with the location information of a marked word. The entries for the marks can be tokens coalesced with prefixes of respective marked words or adjacent. A query processor forms a modified query by adding a mark for a word to the query. The processor executes the modified query.
A database management system stores data form a plurality of logical tables as independent copies in different format. In one specific example the system organizes tables into table groups and de-normalizes the table in each table group. It also organizes data in a second format including vertical column containers that store all the data for one attribute, there being one column container for each table and each attribute within that table. The receipt of a query causes the system to develop a query plan that can interact with either or both of the container sets.
Systems and methods for ranking search engine results based at least in part on user access to the results of previous search inquiries. Results to a search inquiry appearing on a search engine results page are ranked according to their relevance with respect to the search inquiry, and the ranking is based at least in part on an evaluation of user data associated with actions taken by one or more users in response to other search inquiries. The systems and methods retain data associated with search results for future use on a user specific or multi-user basis, and may access this data from local storage or centralized storage within a network.
Synonyms for a term to be indexed are dynamically generated by applying one or more rules (e.g., splitting, deletion or addition of characters, and concatenation of portions) to the term, each synonym generated either including only a portion and not all of the term or differing from the term by at least one additional character in a position between a first character and a last character (i.e., not at either end of the term). The term and some or all of the synonyms are then indexed for subsequent searching.
Amounts of time that search result content is displayed for viewing can be collected and used for relevancy ranking. Selection of a first of a plurality of search results is detected. The plurality of search results is received in response to submission of a set of one or more search terms. An amount of time content of the first search result is displayed for viewing is determined. The content is loaded in response to the selection of the first search result. An indication of the amount of time is supplied as input for ranking relevancy of the first search result with respect to the set of one or more search terms.
